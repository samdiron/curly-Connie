make a file sorter / finder / authenticator / prosccesor
we tested the tcp server/client it works smoothly 
next is configuring the ffmpeg processing for the RTMP, RTP/UDP servers/clients 
but for now we will preconfigur the files to be streamed 
but i think if a file that get streamed more than 1 time will always be in ready to stream form cuz that will reduce the overhead if there is multiple 
clients at the same time so if a file is streamed alot it will be added to a list of files that are preconfig and if a file has the same name as it it will 
not be streamed and we think a better way is to make a option to make all files in the server to a stream ready files or download ready files or both but 
that will take alot of storage now that i have multiple machines i colud saperate the cloud from the server and spread the server to multiple machines
