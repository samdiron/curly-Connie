make a file sorter / finder / authenticator / prosccesor;
we tested the tcp server/client it works smoothly;
next is configuring the ffmpeg processing for the RTMP, RTP/UDP servers/clients; 
but for now we will preconfigur the files to be streamed ;
but i think if a file that get streamed more than 1 time will always be in ready to stream form cuz that will reduce the overhead if there is multiple ;
clients at the same time so if a file is streamed alot it will be added to a list of files that are preconfig and if a file has the same name as it it will ;
not be streamed and we think a better way is to make a option to make all files in the server to a stream ready files or download ready files or both but ;
that will take alot of storage now that i have multiple machines i colud saperate the cloud from the server and spread the server to multiple machines;

!fork: can't decide what rtmp lib to use options are rml_rtmp / rtmp ; 
rml_rtmp is built on top of rtmp and has low/high level api the problem that we can't find good documentation for both so we will study project's that use those libs;
for the next few days ;

update for now  think that it's better to use rml_rtmp for simplicity and in the future maybe rtmp and build on top of it for more configurations.
update will not use it doesn't have all the features that's needed so i will build on top of another rust project;
that has multiple protocols but it's not a crate so will study it for the next few days;
name of the repo xiu;
