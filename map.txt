so to make the server able to do muliple functions we have to use few protocols depending on the use 
for live streaming RTSP // this is not required it's for calls and will not be a priority in dev 
for video/audio and documents streaming RTMP 
for transefer RTP/TCP 
and the main socket is going to be TCP that send info about the server and files to the client 
then on the request of the clinet another socket will be activated on the same ip but different port 

the Connie app is a client and not the socket but it could be turned into an admin client
runs without the launching the Connie desktop but but to configure it for the first time you would have to launch it and
note if the server and the Connie are saperate the server will be download alone eather from a github repo or from Connie desktop 
and it will have a CLI

tools:
surrealdb for database
ffmpeg for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files
tauri for creating the desktop app
docker because there in alot of tools i don't think everybody have them 

note this is just a beta backend every thing will be modified
but everything will be built in rust except the frontend will be built in tauri it's a rust framework that permit to use a javascript framework as a 
frontend we will use next.js for now also tailwind/shadcn will be used 

and in the future a phone client will be made and the tools we're thinking of using for that is 
react naitve
and for the all the backend client will be made in pure kotlin to get the fastest preformace 
note: i will not make an ios/mac version 

new features that could be added to Connie:
plugins compatibility,
cloud optiones:[an external cloud; internal cloud in the same machine],
make a inferstrcture for running an AI
python/mojo module
